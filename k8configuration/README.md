# Each configuration file has 3 parts

1. metadata
2. specification
3. status

=> status is automatically generated by kubernetes.
- There will be Actual state (what we defined in the configuration file)
  and the desired sate. If Actual state Not Equal to Desired state
  then there is some issue which k8 try to fix.
  for e.g, if we change the deployment configuration to create 2 replica
  then k8 identifies there is difference between Actual state & Desired state
  hence it tries to fix this by creating new addition pod.

=> Now from where does k8 gets all these informations.
Ans: It is from etcd. etcd is the brain of k8 master node
    which stores the cluster information.
