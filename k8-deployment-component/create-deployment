# This will pull the latest nginx image from docker hub and deploy it
kubectl create deployment nginx-deploy --image=nginx

# To verify
kubectl get deployments

Notes:
- Deployment is the blueprint of pod which contains info
about name and docker image to be used.
- Replica set is a layer between deployment and pods.
This is automatically managed by kubernetes itself.

# To verify the Replica set
kubectl get rs

# To change the version of image in deployments
1. kubectl edit deployments <deployment name>
2. find the image and add version.
 for e,g: image: nginx:1.16
3. verify kubectl get po
  result would be old pod will get terminated
  and new pod gets started automatically.
