Service connect with deployment pods labels using the selector:
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx

    ports:
    - port: 8000
      targetPort: 8100

port:8000 is where the service itself is running
targetPort: 8100 is the port where pods are listening. So this should match
the container port defined in the deployment configuration.
